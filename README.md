## Last moment on the Earth

The Earth is devasted by the enemy.The
only two survivors, Roger and Rafa are
the last two human survivors. That place
is rounded only by sand, dust and trash
brought from a ruined big near city.

Rafa is laying because his lower body is
smashed by the rock that hit him and his
upper body is full of wounds with the left
arm destroyed. Rafa is unable to move
himself.

Meanwhile Roger is shedding tears, by all
that happens, to his friends and family,
and the whole world. Like I know, we weep
when the emotion is high, not only the
sadness, but other feelings like happiness
or relief, and Roger, this moment is
crying by hatred. He is blaming himself
for didn't be able to save the world
and now he will be the last survivor and
he doesn't agree this.
