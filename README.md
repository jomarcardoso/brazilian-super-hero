## Last moment on the Earth

The Earth is devasted by the enemy.The
only two survivors, Roger and Rafa are
the last two human survivors. That place
is rounded only by sand, dust and trash
brought from a ruined big near city.

Rafa is laying because his lower body is
smashed by the rock that hit him and his
upper body is full of wounds with the left
arm destroyed. Rafa is unable to move
himself.
