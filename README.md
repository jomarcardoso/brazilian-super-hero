## Last moment on the Earth

The Earth is devasted by the enemy.The
only two survivors, Roger and Rafa are
the last two human survivors. That place
is rounded only by sand, dust and trash
brought from a ruined big near city.

Rafa is laying because his lower body is
smashed by the rock that hit him and his
upper body is full of wounds with the left
arm destroyed. Rafa is unable to move
himself.

Meanwhile Roger holding his hammer, face
down and he is shedding tears, by all
that happens, to his friends and family,
and the whole world. Like I know, we weep
when the emotion is high, not only the
sadness, but other feelings like happiness
or relief, and Roger, this moment is
crying by hatred. He is blaming himself
for didn't be able to save the world
and now he will be the last survivor and
he doesn't agree this.

The enemy ship is floating in the sky,
getting the stolen resources. They won
the war. The world is over, not only
humans, but animals and the environment.
The Earth can't recover itself and it will
have the same destiny of Venus.

The hatred of Roger turned into wrath, and
he holder his hammer stronger than ever.
His uncontrolled energy now is straight
like an aura, in other words as angel.
When he got the hammer, the energy went
through it and in the first moment it was
unstable in the the head of the hammer and
deformed the hammer head, but soon he
stabilized the energy and restored the
weapon shape. The noise out loud would
scare any common human.
