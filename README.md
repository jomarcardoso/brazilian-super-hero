## At school

In consequence of his mother sickness, Roger started at school later and Rafa with his father troupe of theater did not learned the first year of school. The repeat student and an unknown kid met at the same school.

They were taller than usual, and even at wrong grade. The regular kids saw them and used to mock them.

Roger have a broke family, and he is usually sad by her mother's situation. The other kids took advantage of this weak boy to do bullying with him. He is called the "ET's son" an this hurt him. He was a big crying kid.

Rafa was called by mean kids, 

## The fight

Zogan was a strong super human with the resistant skin and plates.

Bruno watching Zogan beating and even killing some of his team decide to stop that, run straight at Zogan and punch him hard on the chest. Zogan laughs with some teardrops, he does the same as always showing himself strong, but breathless to laugh much more and of course no time, because Bruno is there for vengeance, and attack again with a side kick. Zogan with hatred face, block the kick with his powerful and protected arm and try a counterattack in Bruno's ribs with his forearm shield lance. Bruno jump back with the hands on the ground and dodge the punch.

Bruno stare at Zogan, and Zogan say the same as always "you are weaker than I taught". Bruno that not speak much, look for a half of second at your friend Tomas dead sitted with a hole in his neck, look at Zogan again for a second, but no seeing him, but thinking, and then nod confirming something to himself.

Me and some people there saw something different different in Bruno that moment. A heat, that visual noise we see in the desert around Bruno. After that one second thinking he goes again and the same side kick, but with the right leg. The blade of the shin cross cutting the arm and stop after the middle of the chest.

## Last moment on the Earth

The Earth is devasted by the enemy.The only two survivors, Roger and Rafa are the last two human survivors. That place is rounded only by sand, dust and trash brought from a ruined big near city.

Rafa is laying because his lower body is smashed by the rock that hit him and his upper body is full of wounds with the left arm destroyed. Rafa is unable to move himself.

Meanwhile Roger holding his hammer, face down and he is shedding tears, by all that happens, to his friends and family, and the whole world. Like I know, we weep when the emotion is high, not only the sadness, but other feelings like happiness or relief, and Roger, this moment is crying by hatred. He is blaming himself for didn't be able to save the world
and now he will be the last survivor and he doesn't agree this.

The enemy ship is floating in the sky, getting the stolen resources. They won the war. The world is over, not only humans, but animals and the environment are completely destroyed. The Earth can't recover itself and it will have the same destiny of Venus the old home of the humans.

While Roger was crying and holding his he have listened to Rafa speaking.

_ Why you haven't given up yet?

That phrase had always the answer: "because I have someone to fight for" it didn't make sense anymore cause had no one alive to protect. That words was the punishment from the person who most believed in Roger e his determination to do all needed to look after who he loves.

Roger looked at his friend laying, and he saw him dead. Does he really said that words? Roger has imagined this? That were the last words of Rafa? We can't we barely know the human capabilities let alone of a prince. What I know is that Rafa was so instinctive. He knew the animals feelings and and felt some unknown source messages. What I guess is that Rafa is with Roger fighting after having died. I know that no one can speak without a mouth and move with no body, but I can't doubt that Rafa have sent his spirit to Roger's body.

That moment I look at Roger's eyes and I saw Rafa's look, that wide eyes, not with the attention of a prey, but with the focus of a hunter. The eyes of Rafa disappeared, the message to Roger was sent. I believe that Roger has enough power to beat anyone, however he had no more motivation for this. I have know idea what Rafa has said to Roger before he has gone, but Rafa knew his friend, and what he needs to hear.

Doesn't matter what happen that moment, it's enough for Roger. The hatred of him turned into wrath, and he hold his hammer stronger than ever. He started to get metal for everything at half of the solar system. The invaders ship that was flying away had committed by tons of metal coming from space, made it turn some kilometers back. At the beginning the bright like the sun then suddenly it becomes dark. Whether have a physicist alive will explain that phenomenon, but all I understood is that hammer has the mass of a black hole.

His uncontrolled energy now is straight like an aura, in other words as angel. When he got the hammer, the energy went through it and in the first moment it was unstable in the the head of the hammer and deformed it, but soon he stabilized the energy and restored the weapon shape. The noise out loud would scare any common human.

The superb of the invaders for easily defeat the human race again, made us trusting to put all collected in the same huge ship. But like Rafa always said, "the fight ends when none of your enemies are left standing". That act was a small mistake in as almost perfect plan of the enemy to loot the planet and leave unharmed. They had never experienced the fury of the prince o princes after lost everything and blame himself for it.
